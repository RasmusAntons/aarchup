# Aarchup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inglor/aarchup.svg?branch=cpp)](https://travis-ci.org/inglor/aarchup)

archup (https://github.com/inglor/aarchup) is a small C++ application which informs the user when system-updates for Archlinux are available.
It is forked from aarchup (https://github.com/aericson/aarchup) and rewritten on C++.

aarchup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It follows the unix-philosophy of "just doing one thing, but doing  it  well". It  can be used to regulary check for new updates and show a desktop notification if there are any.

Read manpages for configuration.
