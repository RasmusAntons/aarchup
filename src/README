aarchup (https://github.com/inglor/aarchup) is a small C++ application which informs the user when system-updates for Archlinux are available. It's licenced under the GPLv3. In contrast to other update notifiers aarchup is intended to be lightweight and just do what it should: notify about possible updates.
It is forked from aarchup (https://github.com/aericson/aarchup) and rewritten on C++.

aarchup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It follows the unix-philosophy of "just doing one thing, but doing  it  well". It  can be used to regulary check for new updates and show a desktop notification if there are any.

Read manpages for configuration.

Thanks

Rorschach, for the great tool and the credits are all his (https://github.com/aericson/aarchup)
The reason this fork exists is to add some build testing on aarchup and improve see modern c++ world.
